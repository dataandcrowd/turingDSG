# Approach 1: Exploring the structrue of air quality data for Bristol
## Theory
- There are ample evidence of negative relationships between NO<sub>x</sub> and children's risk of health e.g. asthma, headache, obstacles of growth.
- Some schoolzones in Bristol are now facing a serious risk of pollution due to the high volume of vehicles that park and travel during rush hours, which can badly affect their health.
- Here, this section explores the temporal features of NO<sub>x</sub> and examine the relationship on schoolzones.

## Data collection

- Bristol city council has released a diverse range of dataset on their [Bristol Opendata Portal](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/pages/homepage/). 
- We collected [live and historic air quality continous data (1998-2019)](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/explore/dataset/air-quality-data-continuous/information/?disjunctive.location) from 16 data stations.
- 7 Stations (location with bold text) are currently monitored
