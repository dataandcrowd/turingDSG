# Approach X: Exploring the structrue of air quality data for Bristol
## 1. Background
- There are ample evidence of inverse relationships between NO<sub>x</sub> and children's risk of health e.g. exposure, asthma, headache, and mental health.
    - [Roosbroeck et al.(2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231006012878) measured personal exposure to traffic-related air pollution in Utercht, the Netherlands. From 54 young participants, the personal exposure to NO<sub>x</sub> was 37% lower on near-road schoolers compared to background schoolers.
    - [Kim et al. (2004)](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.200403-281OC) conducted 10 school-based surveys from students who walk to school to compare NOx exposure levels based on their residential location in San Fransisco, USA. Using a logistic model, children who lived within 300m to major roads and at a downwinded location have higher exposure levels(OR: 1.05Â±0.1) compared to those who live far and upwind of major roads.
    - [Robert et al. (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517811830800X) analysed a longitudinal cohort study of London-based teenagers and discovered that the 18-year olds who have had depression was associated with high pollution exposure when they were 12 years old (Age-12 pollution exposure was not associated with age-12 mental health problems).  

- Schoolzones in Bristol are still facing a serious risk of pollution due to a high volume of vehicles on during drop-off and pick-up times, which can badly affect their health. According to [Bristol local news](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/roads-outside-schools-could-closed-3001742), the city council are considering to close roads outside schools. 

- However, we argue that the proposed plans can only take into further consideration with the rigorous exploration of pollutants and related components.

- Here, this section firsly explores the general features of pollutants (NO<sub>x</sub>) and weather determinants, then examines a schoolzone as a case study.


## 2. Data collection
### 2.1. Pollution

- Bristol city council has released a diverse range of dataset on their [Bristol Opendata Portal](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/pages/homepage/). Amongst the data, we collected [live and historic air quality continous data (1998-2019)](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/explore/dataset/air-quality-data-continuous/information/?disjunctive.location) from 16 monitoring stations.
